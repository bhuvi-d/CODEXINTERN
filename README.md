## Task 1: Data Analysis and Visualization Using Pandas and Matplotlib

In this task, a CSV file is loaded using the Pandas library to perform basic data analysis, such as calculating the average of a selected column. The data is then visualized using Matplotlib through bar charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps to understand patterns and relationships. Insights and observations are drawn based on the visual outputs and statistical summaries to provide a deeper understanding of the dataset.

## Task 2: House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

This task involves building a linear regression model to predict house prices based on features such as the number of rooms, location, and size. A suitable dataset is collected from Kaggle and undergoes preprocessing including cleaning, encoding, and normalization. The processed data is then used to train and evaluate the model to ensure accurate predictions of house prices.
